# Cryptocurrencies
## This project was created to learn the use of unsupervised machine learning models. This fun project's purpose was to help identify cryptocurrencies, their trading patterns, and a way to group them in a classification system for investments opportunities.

## For this project, an environment was created that holds the dependencies our machine learning model and then adapted to Jupyter Notebook. Pandas, Scikitlearn, and hvplot from pandas were used to perform the data transformation and load the data into a machine learning model.
